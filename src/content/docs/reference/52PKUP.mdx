title: 52PKUP
---

## Description
Subject 52PKUP is a single-player video game created by now-defunct game studio ███████. The copy currently in ARGroup archives is a digital beta release of the game, released on the Steam Workshop on 4/1/23 and subsequently removed by ARGroup personnel.
52PKUP is a poker-based game that concerns building the highest-scoring hands possible. Each of the different selectable “decks” in the game has a memetic agent on its card back pattern, including:
- Crimson Deck: causes the player physical pain upon losing, becoming more and more intense as difficulty increases.
- Holy Deck: causes the player to aggressively recommend 52PKUP to others.
- Void Deck: causes the sensation of drowning for the player when 52PKUP is not running on their computer.
- Secret Deck: kill agent.

## Origin
ARGroup Memetics Division personnel were alerted to 52PKUP’s existence by Reddit posts in April 2023 mentioning a “creepypasta Balatro ripoff” that had killed several players. The beta release of the game was investigated and subsequently contained.

## Containment Procedure
52PKUP was wiped from the Steam Workshop by ARGroup personnel on 4/14/23, and all other copies subsequently found and removed from internet piracy sources. ARGroup Task Force Omega-6 (“Poker Jokers”) raided ███████’s offices on 4/16/23 and found them abandoned. 
The last known copy of 52PKUP resides on ARGroup archival servers, and is accessible under the supervision of the Memetics Division.

## Notes
Actually pretty fun as long as you have the proper antimemetics, but it’s no Balatro. - Dr. Lamb, Memetics Division Acting Chair
