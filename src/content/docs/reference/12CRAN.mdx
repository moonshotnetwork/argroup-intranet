title: 12CRAN
---

## Description
Subject 12CRAN is a batch of 7.5 fl oz cans of REDACTED-brand cranberry-flavored ginger ale. Its chemical properties, taste, and appearance seem identical to ordinary REDACTED brand cranberry-flavored ginger ale. However, consuming 12CRAN will, regardless of the drinker’s prior identity and orientation, cause the person consuming it to begin identifying as a lesbian. The effects appear to be immediate, even in individuals who might otherwise take much longer to process such a change in their identity.

## Origin
Subject 12CRAN was originally discovered by employees at a REDACTED warehouse where the batch was being held prior to shipping. Five employees experienced 12CRAN’s anomalous effects after stealing samples for themselves. Noticing the pattern, shift supervisor Haley Reed submitted a tip through ARGroup’s online portal on 6/5/2023. ARGroup personnel arrived on 6/6/2023 to confiscate the entire batch, and neither the warehouse nor consumers have reported any further anomalous effects connected with REDACTED-brand cranberry-flavored ginger ale.

## Containment Procedure
Subject 12CRAN is being held in a temperature-controlled cooler in the office of researcher Jennifer Blecher. Cans of Subject 12CRAN are not to be consumed by anyone without prior approval from Senior Researcher Jakob Sauter].

Edit 6/10/2023: All known cans of 12CRAN are now being held in a temperature-controlled cooler in the office of Senior Researcher Jakob Sauter.

Edit 3/1/2024: All known cans of 12CRAN are now expired. They have been moved to a locked container in LSS 2. Storage location may be re-evaluated pending any further incidents.

## Notes
I kinda think turning someone into a lesbian constitutes more than minor disruption. -Everleigh
We don’t have a number for major disruption. Unless you want to make the argument that becoming a lesbian is harm??? -Sauter
