## Description
00MDFL is the state flag of Maryland. It is speculated to have anomalous memetic properties due to its outsized amount of merchandise sold per year, in spite of both locals and tourists widely deriding the flag’s design.

## Origin
Do I actually have to write a book report on the Maryland state flag. Is that what we’re doing here. - Dr. Inneson


## Containment Procedure
None considered necessary.

## Notes
How are we actually going to prove this one? Send a bunch of interns to live in Baltimore for a year and see what happens? - Inneson
It’s not your worst idea ever. I could spare a few interns. - Lamb

## Incident Reports
None
