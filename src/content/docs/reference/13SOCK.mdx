## Description
Subject 13SOCK is a single white Hanes brand cotton crew sock, size 6-12. Approximately every 3.7 hours this sock will duplicate, and an identical sock will appear within 0.7ft. This event only happens when the item goes unobserved. These copies maintain none of the anomalous properties of the original. Researchers have marked subject 13SOCK with a 1/16th” dot on the heel using red marker and discovered that it does not pass on stains and markings to it’s copies.

## Origin
Subject was discovered among the personal items of Dr. Watters in 2019, when during his 20 month ARGroup residence at Station Delta his uppermost drawer filled with copies of 13SOCK. Subject was identified and turned over to ARGroup custody.

## Containment Procedure
Subject is to be contained in a clear plastic type 8A bin in LSS 3. Duplicates are to be removed once a month, paired off, and sent home with group employees.

Edit 10/05/2021: Item is to be further marked with a label safety pinned to the subject.

## Notes
I am no longer asking if people want socks. - Dir. Hellmen
