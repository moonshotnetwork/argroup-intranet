title: 42MGUN
---

## Description
42MGUN is a functional Smith & Wesson Model 19 revolver that cures lactose intolerance in anyone who has been shot by a bullet fired from it.

## Origin
42MGUN was confiscated from the home of Adrian Mason, who had purchased the firearm for personal protection and subsequently accidentally misfired it into his own leg. Mason noticed 42MGUN’s anomalous effect upon being provided with a carton of chocolate milk during his hospital stay and suffering no ill effects from drinking it.

## Containment Procedure
42MGUN is contained in a temperature-controlled briefcase in ARGroup Archives Sub-Level 2. Permission from a Clearance Level 5 or higher supervisor is required to access.

## Notes
None

## Incident Reports
Containment procedures revised on 6/18/2020 after ARGroup interns Gregory Yancy and Henrietta Hill removed 42MGUN from containment due to an agreement both referred to as a “pact”. Yancy sustained a single gunshot wound to the upper right arm, while Hill sustained a single gunshot wound to the left side. Both report no further trouble processing dairy afterwards, and have been disciplined by their respective supervisors.
