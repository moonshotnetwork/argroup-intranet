title: 22CAST

## Description
Subject 22CAST is a “Patreon bonus” episode of the ███████ ████ podcast which causes a gradually increasing feeling of distress within the listener throughout its runtime. Known symptoms of listening for the entire thirty-minute duration of the episode include extreme fatigue, a feeling of being “hunted”, the desire to apologize for past errors or mistakes, nausea, inescapable dread, and abject misery.

## Origin
22CAST was posted on the Patreon feed of the ███████ ████ podcast on 1/19/18. Listeners subsequently reported on the podcast’s Reddit page and Discord server that the episode made them feel “wrong”, “upset”, and “like [they were] having a [DATA EXPUNGED] bad trip”. Researcher LeBeau, a fan of ███████ ████, brought these reports to ARGroup’s attention shortly afterwards.

## Containment Procedure
███████ ████ hosts were encouraged by ARGroup personnel to remove the episode from their Patreon feed, and it subsequently disappeared from all listener RSS feeds afterwards. A recovered mp3 is on file in ARGroup digital archives, but requires Level 3 Clearance or higher to access.
