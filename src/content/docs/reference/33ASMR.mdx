title: 33ASMR

## Description
Subject 33ASMR is a YouTube channel that produces video, live-streamed, and short video “ASMR” (Autonomous sensory meridian response) content focused on the production of cafe-style beverages. While this content is nominally intended to be “relaxing,” continued exposure to the subject causes a steadily-increasing sense of frustration and rage in viewers for reasons that are ACTUALLY VERY REASONABLE, THANKS. Attempts to discuss 33ASMR, regardless of the personality of the viewer and the formality of the context, become quickly derailed by complaints that sound completely UNHINGED to anyone who hasn’t SEEN the videos but if you watch them you will understand, I PROMISE. We’re pretty sure this is how it spreads but okay listen. NOBODY needs that much ice in their drink and I realize that doesn’t sound that annoying but when it’s EVERY ONE- and by the way what flavor is BLUE? BLUE???? BLUE?????????????????

## Origin
We found this godawful [DATA EXPUNGED] thing on Reddit, where all the godawful [DATA EXPUNGED] things on the internet come from. The YouTube channel has been active since October, 2022, although researchers have been unable to verify if 33ASMR is the only channel of its kind due to the nature of its content, and it might not even be the original manifestation of this effect, god FORBID-

## Containment Procedure
33ASMR has been removed from YouTube by ARGroup personnel as of 8/12/2023, although an archive of its contents remains on ARGroup’s servers for further research. This archive is periodically updated with new videos, shorts, and even live streams (THAT SHOULDN’T BE POSSIBLE?????) by an unknown source. This source also periodically attempts to re-launch the public channel, necessitating a weekly sweep of YouTube by ARGroup personnel to ensure no 33ASMR content has been posted on any channel. Access to the archived content is strongly discouraged without the use of anti-memetics, but you can’t STOP me, dude, it’s like a train wreck, you can’t look away.
