## Description
Subject 31DRNK appears to be a standard soda vending machine with six drink options all reading “MYSTERY”. Upon depositing two dollars US currency into the machine, the user may select an option, and receive a drink. Drinks offered by the machine change regularly without any apparent external maintenance or routine schedule.
Notable prior mystery drinks include Grapefruit Zazz Shasta, Bamboo Yuzu Pepsi, Raspberry Cream Coke[(1)](#notes), Lemon-Lime Panic\![(2)](#notes), and Birthday Cake Bang Energy. Certain drinks appear to rotate in and out of the machine at regular intervals, but new options are still being discovered as of 6/30/2025.

## Origin
31DRNK was first discovered via reports of a “mystery vending machine” that had appeared on a street corner of Portland, OR, and very quickly achieved viral internet fame. Subject was not considered to be anomalous at first, but monitored by ARGroup personnel until reports were found of 31DRNK dispensing non-extant brands of soda and energy drink.

## Containment Procedure
31DRNK is currently stored in the 3rd floor personnel break room and is monitored regularly by ARGroup researchers.

## Notes
After containment, 31DRNK has also been found to dispense non-extant flavors of recognized brands.

## Incident Reports
